Implementation for Project on Effects of Finite System Size for Partonic energy loss in a QGP

Mathematica notebooks in this repository follow the discusion in my report which should provide context for what the notebooks are use to implement. 
The notebooks themselves provide further computational details.

Please follow the notebooks in the numbered order. 
Notebook 1 corresponds roughly to sections 3.1 to 3.4 in the report
NOtebook 2 to sections 3.5 to 4.4
Notebook 3 to section 5
Notebook 4 to sections 5-6
